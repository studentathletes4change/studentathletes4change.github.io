My name is Wren Aye and I am a former Student-Athlete at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in Financial Economics and a minor in Information Systems. I chose those two focuses because I believe numbers tell a story and since the world is moving towards cloud-based systems and computer technology, it was best to incorporate that into my studies. After graduation, I moved to Germany for 8 months as Iâ€™ve always been someone that likes to get out of my comfort zone. After coming back to the US due to Covid-19, I started my baking business that offers domestic shipping, Sewrenity Sweets. My customers favorite items are my Cinnawren Rolls, Vegan Banana Bread, and Cookie Cups. After the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless others, I decided to start this page to give Student-Athletes the platform to use their voices to implement change. Thank you for joining this journey.
