        <p>As an athlete throughout my childhood, I always had my hair in a ponytail. There was
          never really time for me to “do” my hair and wear it out. If I did want to do my hair, it would only
          last one day; the sweat from practice would create a massive indent. Hence...the ponytail. I was
          not about to re-straighten my hair for me to continuously go through this hair cycle. I was
          tempted to straighten it, but I was talked out of it multiple times by mom to preserve the health of
          my hair. But why did I want my hair to be straightened so much?
          </p>
        
          <div id="article2" class="containerTab" style="display:none; position: relative;">
              <!-- <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;" class="closebtn">X</span> -->
              <p>What I forgot to mention was that I was one of few black girls playing soccer growing up.
                So all I knew was white girls with straight hair who could easily wash their hair after practice and
                have it straight again without having to do really anything to it. Must be nice, huh? Since white
                girls were what I usually saw, I wanted to fit in desperately and have hair like them. Through this
                journey I continued to perm my hair to make sure that it was always straight, rain or shine. My
                kinky curls were no more. I figured, if I couldn’t have hair exactly like them, getting a perm was
                the next best thing. Perm after perm after perm, I slowly started to feel like I fit in. But perm after
                perm after perm, I started to notice my hair breaking off. Not just breaking off like your daily
                shedding but BREAKING OFF. Like tree bark breaking off from the tree breaking off. So the
                question then became, what did I want to give up? Did I want to give up looking like my white
                teammates or did I want to give up my hair? If you really think about that question, my hair was
                going to break off completely in the end with each of these decisions, but it was more so a
                matter of determining how long to postpone the inevitable.

                <br><br>Fast forward to my senior year of high school and my hair was absolutely trashed. So
                unhealthy and so damaged. So, yes, I decided to continue to get perms when I was little up until
                this point because I so desperately wanted to fit in. It became evident that I desperately needed
                to make a change with my hair. I was not fully ready to give up on my hair completely so I ended
                up getting twists to help grow and strengthen it. But ultimately, my hair couldn’t grow until I cut
                off all of the damaged pieces of it…which basically meant the majority of my hair. Considering
                how desperately I wanted to fit in throughout my childhood, this decision to cut my damaged
                hair was really upsetting. About 6 months later, after a big chop, I got the twists again. No one
                ever saw my big chop because I felt ashamed. I didn’t feel pretty in accordance with what I
                thought to be society’s definitions of “pretty”: being blonde and having straight hair. I got the
                twists immediately after my big chop to mask the chop. When I got the twists, I was still hesitant
                about them because I still felt like it wasn’t the norm, but at this point I didn’t have a choice. I
                eventually got over my hesitations and ended up wearing the twists for about 2 years, my
                freshman and sophomore years in college. I saw tremendous growth, but I still wasn’t satisfied. I
                wanted my hair to be back to my original shoulder length and straight.
                
                
                <br><br>What I did notice during my first two years of college, though, were other black girls and
                their hair. I noticed so many girls wearing their natural curly hair, twists/braids that included hair
                extensions, and other protective styles. Two of my black teammates even had their hair
                completely shaved. Seeing all of these black women rock their hairstyles gave me confidence to
                continue wearing my twists and to even try other protective styles. Seeing these hairstyles
                normalized what a typical soccer player was supposed to look like to me. As I mentioned earlier,
                growing up, I hardly ever saw these hairstyles and naturally aspired to look like the girls around
                me. I hardly ever saw black girls wearing their natural curls. But now, in today’s society, it is so
                common to see a black woman wearing her curls or a protective style unapologetically. I am so
                thankful for this change. It is paving the way for younger black girls, in any sport, to be okay with
                their hair! To be happy with their kinky, coily hair. To embrace it. To not feel the need to get
                perms or always have their hair straight to fit in. It’s something so small, but it can affect so
                many young black girls. I know I would have loved to realize this earlier in my life...that any
                hairstyle I chose was acceptable!

      <p>Supporting the Black Lives Matter movement is not a political issue. It is a moral one.
        <br><br>If you hear someone state “Black Lives Matter” and your immediate response is to try to refute that, please ask yourselves why. Because the only reason to argue that statement is if you believe that Black lives don’t matter.
      </p>

        <p>If you cannot see that Black people are treated exponentially worse than white people by essentially every American institution, you have purposefully chosen to turn a blind eye or chosen to be willfully ignorant. If you know it to be true that Black people (as well as other racial and ethnic minorities) are mistreated and choose to ignore it, or stay silent, you are exercising your white privilege, which is inexcusable.

            <br><br>“Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.” It is not acceptable to stay neutral. We must fight for Black lives. Attached is a link as to what you personally can do to help the movement and demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and others.
            
            <br><br>https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/
            
            <br><br>This fight cannot stop when the hashtag stops trending. We must commit to fight racism and racist institutions. That begins with educating ourselves on what it means to be anti racist, here are several books that are a good start.
            <br><br>Me and White Supremacy by Layla F. Saad
            <br>How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi
            <br>Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates
            <br>Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? by Beverly Daniel Tatum
            <br><br>Lastly, many of the people who have turned to quotes by MLK Jr. to argue against violent protests are forgetting what he said regarding riots: "A riot is the language of the unheard." Before you criticize how people are protesting, ask yourself why the destruction of a country that Black people suffered to build is so much more upsetting to you than the murder of an innocent Black man. Property is never worth more than human life.
            <br><br>If you are still unconvinced that Black lives are worth fighting for, I am both saddened and horrified. Black people should not have to justify their humanity to society.
            <br><br><b>Katie's Bio:</b>
