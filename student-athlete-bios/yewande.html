Former Maryland assistant coach and Terrapin goalkeeper Yewande Balogun joins the UC Davis women’s soccer staff as an assistant coach for the 2019 season.

<br><br>“I am so grateful and honored to have Yewande make this brave move across the country and join our staff,” Hamm said. “Her high-caliber playing experience and proven success as a collegiate goalkeeper coach will add depth and value to our program. Yewande is committed to the holistic growth of student-athletes, as well as her own professional development. I am thrilled to add her energy, enthusiasm, and knowledge to the Aggie family.”

<br><br>Balogun spent the last three seasons as an assistant coach in charge of the goalkeepers at her alma mater, helping tutor Rachel Egyed to All-Big Ten honors in 2017 and 2018 — the first-ever Maryland keeper to earn a spot on an All-Big Ten team. Egyed finished her career among the program’s top 10 in both career goals against average (1.50) and saves (183), while Balogun’s work with the defense helped the Terrapins cut their team goals allowed by more than half during her tenure, from 48 in 2016 down to 22 in 2018.

<br><br>Among her other coaching responsibilities, Balogun assisted with video analysis, organized and coordinated Maryland soccer summer camps and ID clinics, and helped coordinated the program’s recruiting efforts, resulting in a top 25 freshman class in 2017 and a top 50 class in 2018.

<br><br>Along the lines of UC Davis’ own Aggie EVO program, Balogun created Maryland’s “MenTERPship Program,” which connected women’s soccer student-athletes with the program’s alumni to discuss academic and professional interests, potential career paths, and help with the transition from student-athlete to career life.

<br><br>“I am so grateful to be a part of the Aggies’ women's soccer program and the UC Davis community,” Balogun said. “I am blessed to join an athletic department with such impressive leadership and  attentiveness to the full student-athlete experience.  Thank you to Coach Tracy Hamm for this incredible opportunity.”

<br><br>Prior to her tenure at Maryland, Balogun oversaw the development of senior goalkeeper Charlene Belanger during her lone season as an assistant at American University in Washington, D.C., helping her make improvements in goals against (1.61), shutouts (three), and save percentage (.756), from the season prior. The Eagles advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2015 Patriot League Tournament and posted 14 student-athletes on the league’s academic honor roll.

<br><br>At the club level, Balogun was an assistant coach at the U15 and U16 levels with the Soccer Association of Columbia, an assistant coach with the Maryland State Youth Soccer Association Boys’ Olympic Development Program, and the Director of Goalkeeping with Maryland United FC. She also served as the operations manager for the former Maryland Capitols FC of the Women’s Premier Soccer League.

<br><br>One of the most decorated goalkeepers in Maryland history, Balogun helped the Terrapins reach the “Sweet 16” of the NCAA Tournament twice in 2009 and 2011, as well as an appearance in the 2010 Atlantic Coast Conference championship match, earning All-ACC Academic Team and all-tournament honors. As a freshman in 2007, Balogun was a SoccerBuzz Freshman All-American and was selected to the ACC All-Freshman Team.

<br><br>She finished her career as the school’s career leader in goals against average (0.93), was third in games started (64), sixth in saves (242), and tied for second in shutouts (19). She defeated seven ranked teams — including four wins over top-10 teams, during her career.

<br><br>She also helped lead the Ottawa Fury of the W-League to the 2009 league semifinals and competed with the Washington Freedom W-League squad in 2010. In 2011, she was a member of the Chesapeake Charge in the WPSL, helping the team to an Open Cup finals appearance and a WPSL regional finals berth.

<br><br>As a prep, Balogun was one of the top goalkeeping recruits in the country out of Eleanor Roosevelt High School, helping lead the Raiders to a 4A class state championship. She was involved in the US National Team as a 2007 U-20 National Camp invitee and U-14 and U-17 national team pool member. She was a two-time NSCAA/Adidas Youth All-American and 2006 high school All-American.

<br><br>The Prince George’s County, Md., native holds a United States Soccer Federation “D” License and United Soccer Coaches Goalkeeping Level III Diploma, and is on track to earn her USSF “C” License in June of 2019. She earned her bachelor’s degree in marketing from Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business in 2011 and, later, earned her MBA in 2016.
